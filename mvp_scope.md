For the highest-impact MVP, I'd focus exclusively on the "User Struggle Detection and Email Assistance" feature. Here's how we can streamline it:
Highest-Impact MVP: User Struggle Detection & Email Assistance
Core Functionality:

Identify users struggling with a single high-value feature (choose your most important or complex feature)
Generate personalized help content specifically for that feature
Deliver assistance via email only

Simplified User Flow:

Daily Check - System runs once daily to identify users who:

Attempted the feature multiple times (>3 attempts)
Have a low completion rate (<30%)
Experienced errors with the feature


Simplified Content Generation - For identified users:

Create a step-by-step tutorial addressing common sticking points
Include screenshot guidance for the most confusing parts
Personalize with just the user's name


Basic Delivery - Send via email with:

Clear subject line: "Quick help with [Feature Name]"
Concise, helpful content
Link back to the feature


Basic Tracking - Monitor:

Email open rates
Whether users successfully used the feature after receiving help



Technical Requirements:

Mixpanel API connection (read-only)
SendGrid for email delivery
Single feature documentation source
Basic job scheduler (cron)

This focused approach delivers the core value proposition—helping struggling users succeed—while minimizing development time and complexity. You can demonstrate measurable impact by tracking before/after completion rates for the targeted feature.
Once this proves successful, you can expand to additional features, communication channels, and more sophisticated personalization.
