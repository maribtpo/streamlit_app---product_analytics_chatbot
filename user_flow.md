# Mixpanel AI Agent: Detailed User Flow

## Overview
This document outlines the end-to-end user flow for the Mixpanel AI Agent MVP, detailing the system processes and user interactions. The agent proactively identifies users struggling with specific features, generates personalized tutorial content, and delivers it through their preferred communication channel.

## System Flow

### 1. Data Collection & Analysis Phase
- **Trigger**: Scheduled daily job runs at 2:00 AM UTC
- **Process**:
  1. Agent connects to Mixpanel API using configured credentials
  2. Retrieves event data for monitored features (last 7 days)
  3. For each feature, runs JQL queries to identify struggling users based on:
     - High attempt counts (>3 attempts)
     - Low completion rates (<30%)
     - Error events associated with the feature
  4. Creates a prioritized list of users who need assistance
  5. Logs analysis results for monitoring

### 2. Content Generation Phase
- **Trigger**: For each identified struggling user
- **Process**:
  1. Agent retrieves user profile data (name, email, preferences)
  2. Accesses feature documentation from knowledge base
  3. Analyzes user's specific struggle points (which steps caused errors, etc.)
  4. Builds context for content generation using MCP
  5. Generates personalized tutorial content tailored to user's specific issues
  6. Formats content according to delivery channel requirements
  7. Logs content generation for review

### 3. Content Delivery Phase
- **Trigger**: After content generation for a user
- **Process**:
  1. Agent determines optimal delivery channel (email by default for MVP)
  2. Prepares email with personalized subject line and content
  3. Sends email via SendGrid API
  4. Records delivery attempt in system
  5. Handles delivery failures with retry logic
  6. Logs delivery status for monitoring

### 4. Feedback & Learning Phase
- **Trigger**: After content delivery
- **Process**:
  1. Agent creates tracking links in delivered content
  2. Monitors user engagement with tutorial (opens, clicks, time spent)
  3. Tracks if user successfully completes feature after tutorial
  4. Updates user's profile with assistance history
  5. Improves future content generation based on success patterns
  6. Logs feedback metrics for system improvement

## User Experience Flow

### 1. User Struggle Stage
- **User Actions**:
  - Attempts to use a feature multiple times
  - Experiences errors or abandons the process
  - Shows signs of frustration (rapid clicks, abandonment)
- **System**: Silently monitoring and recording these interactions via Mixpanel

### 2. Assistance Delivery Stage
- **User Experience**:
  - Receives an email with subject line like "Quick help with [Feature Name]"
  - Email appears personalized with their name and specific issues
  - Content includes clear, step-by-step instructions
  - Visual elements (if any) highlight exactly where they were struggling
  - No action required from user other than reading the tutorial

### 3. Re-engagement Stage
- **User Actions**:
  - Opens the email (tracked)
  - Clicks on any links within the tutorial (tracked)
  - Returns to the product to try the feature again
  - Successfully completes the action they were struggling with
- **System**: Monitors these actions to measure effectiveness

### 4. Follow-up Stage (Future Enhancement)
- **User Experience**:
  - Receives a brief follow-up question 24 hours later
  - Asked if the tutorial was helpful (simple yes/no)
  - Provided opportunity to request additional help
- **System**: Collects feedback to improve future assistance

## Technical Requirements

### Data Sources
- Mixpanel API access for event data
- User profile database for personalization
- Feature documentation repository

### Integration Points
- Mixpanel API (data retrieval)
- SendGrid API (email delivery)
- Knowledge base API (feature documentation)
- User preference database (communication preferences)

### Monitoring & Metrics
- Number of users identified as struggling
- Content generation success rate
- Email delivery/open rates
- Feature completion rates after assistance
- User feedback metrics

## MVP Scope Limitations
- Email is the only communication channel in initial release
- Limited to monitoring 3-5 key features
- No real-time detection (daily batch process only)
- Basic personalization (name, specific error points)
- No integration with customer support ticketing system
